One of the simplest ways to speed up a website is to use **Pagination**. Pagination just means "to add pages" to something.

You have seen this before because Google has a very recognizable pagination system:

# Make a Plan

Once again - no matter how small the feature is, it's always good to write out the steps you plan to take to implement a feature.

Let's code from the **Outside-In**, so we'll start with the views, then do the controllers, and finally use or extend the models and database.

1. We are going to add pagination to the `/` and `/search` routes first and those both use the `pets-index.pug` template, so we can use bootstrap's pagination snippet to start that.
1. Next we need to add the `mongoose-paginate` module  to extend Mongoose with pagination methods to only return pages of 10 pets.

# Pagination Navigation Snippet

> Let's add this `nav` snippet to the bottom of the `pets-index.pug` template.
>
```pug
block content
    .row
...
    nav(aria-label='Page navigation example').d-flex.justify-content-center
      ul.pagination
        li.page-item
          a.page-link(href='#') Previous
        li.page-item
          a.page-link(href='#') 1
        li.page-item
          a.page-link(href='#') 2
        li.page-item
          a.page-link(href='#') 3
        li.page-item
          a.page-link(href='#') Next
```

It doesn't do much right now... its totally static! We'll have to do some work to make it respond intelligently to the number of pet records we have. For example, if there are 35 records, there should be 4 pages, (at most 10 per page, 5 on the fourth page).

# Pagination Module

Mongoose does not ship with pagination supported, but we can add it using the `mongoose-paginate` module because [edwardhotchkiss](https://github.com/edwardhotchkiss/mongoose-paginate) made it!

**NOTE:** This plugin will only work with Node.js >= 4.2 and Mongoose >= 4.2, so make sure both are updated accordingly.

> Add the `mongoose-paginate` module
>
```bash
$ npm install mongoose-paginate --save
```
>
> Now initialize it, set its defaults options, and add it as a plugin for `/models/pet.js`:
>
```js
// pet.js
...
>
const mongoosePaginate = require('mongoose-paginate');
>
mongoosePaginate.paginate.options = {
  limit: 3 // how many records on each page
};
>
const PetSchema = new Schema({
  ...
})
>
...
>
PetSchema.plugin(mongoosePaginate);
>
// This line is the same as before
module.exports = mongoose.model('Pet', PetSchema);
```

To do a smoke test of this working let's use the new `.paginate()` function on our model in the `/` route query.

> Update `/routes/index/get` in `index.js` to be the following:
>
```js
//index.js
>
/* GET home page. */
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  Pet.paginate().then((results) => {
    res.render('pets-index', { pets: results.docs });    
  });
});
```

You should only see 3 dogs on the page. The pagination buttons won't work yet, don't worry, we're gonna build that out now!

Mongoose-paginate returns only a `results` variable that has these properties:

```js
result.docs // the array of records on the current page
result.total // the total number of records
result.limit // the limit
result.page // the current page
result.pages // the total number of pages
```

The `docs` node is our array that will contain our Pets that we'll display:

```
{ docs:
  [ { _id: 5b0dc8a131fcd81863b9693c,
      id: 0,
      name: 'Rex',
      species: 'Rottweiler',
      birthday: '20017-11-11',
      favoriteFood: 'Chicken',
      picUrl: 'ht
      ...
```

So we have to update our response to access the `docs` node of this JSON and return that array as `pets` to our template.

# Page Parameter

So how do we move from page to page? Well if you have used pagination on a few websites, you'll notice that the url is updated based on what page you are on:

```
Yelp calls it "start"
https://www.yelp.com/search?find_loc=San+Francisco%2C+CA&start=20

Reddit calls it "count"
https://www.reddit.com/?count=25&after=t3_8qkf60
```

We're going to call it `page`.

```
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/?page=2
http://localhost:3000/?page=3
```

> Update `/routes/index/get` in `index.js` to be the following:
>
```js
/* GET home page. */
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const page = req.query.page || 1
>
  Pet.paginate({}, {page: page}).then((results) => {
    res.render('pets-index', { pets: results.docs });    
  });
});
```

Notice that we're using the `||` or `or` operator to make sure there is always a value for `page`. In JavaScript and some other languages, the `||` operator will evaluate to it's "truthy" value, meaning if `req.query.page` is `null` or `undefined`, `page` will be equal to `1`.


> Test out if the following `localhost` urls are working by typing them directly into your browser:
>
```
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/?page=2
http://localhost:3000/?page=3
```

# Pagination Navigation Snippet (Part Deux)

So back to our pagination snippet. We can successfully navigate to the different pages, but only if we know the URL. We gotta make our navigation snippet work so that it behaves like the Gooooooogle one.

Remember that a `mongoose-paginate` query returns these elements:

```js
result.docs // the array of records on the current page
result.total // the total number of records
result.limit // the limit
result.page // the current page
result.pages // the total number of pages
```

Let's use this in the template to make our pagination snippet dynamically respond to however many records we have. We're going to use `results.pages` and rename it `pagesCount` because that is a more accurate naming convention because now we know it is an integer.

> Update the `res.render` line from `/routes/index/get` in `index.js` to include `pagesCount`:
>
```js
res.render('pets-index', { pets: results.docs, pagesCount: results.pages });
```

Now we need to use pug's built in `while` iterator to loop over the `pagesCount` variable to make a number for each of our pages.

> Update your `nav` component in `/views/pets-index.pug` to the following:
>
```pug
nav(aria-label='Page navigation example').d-flex.justify-content-center
  ul.pagination
    li.page-item
      a.page-link(href='#') Previous
>
    - var i = 1;
    while i <= pagesCount
      li.page-item
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${i}`)= i++
>
    li.page-item
      a.page-link(href='#') Next
```

# Next & Previous Buttons

Finally we need to make the Next and Previous buttons work. For that we will add `currentPage` to the template. We'll use the `currentPage` to do some math to derive the previous and the next button, and to hide them if they are not necessary, like on the first and last pages.

> Update the `res.render` line from `/routes/index/get` in `index.js` to include `currentPage`:
>
```js
/* GET home page. */
res.render('pets-index', { pets: results.docs, pagesCount: results.pages, currentPage: page });
```

Now we can use `currentPage` to move forward and backwards from this page. One snafu is that `currentPage` becomes a string when it is rendered here, so we have to use the `parseInt()` function in JavaScript to parse the string back into an integer to do math with it.

> Update your `nav` component in `/views/pets-index.pug` to the following:
>
```pug
nav(aria-label='Page navigation example').d-flex.justify-content-center
  ul.pagination
    if currentPage > 1
      li.page-item
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${currentPage - 1}`) Previous
>
    - var i = 1;
    while i <= pagesCount
      li.page-item
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${i}`)= i++
>
    if currentPage < pagesCount
      li.page-item
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${parseInt(currentPage) + 1}`) Next
```

See if your pagination works!

$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Implemented pagination on the home page'

# Paginate Search

Now let's make sure that the `/search` results are also paginated!

## Update the Route
First thing is to remember that the first parameter to the `paginate` function is a query. Right now it's empty, but what we can do instead is to take our existing `$or` query and put it as that query parameter for `paginate`!

> Update the `/search` route in `/routes/pets.js` to the following:
>
```js
// SEARCH PET
  app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
>
    const term = new RegExp(req.query.term, 'i')
>
    const page = req.query.page || 1
    Pet.paginate(
      {
        $or: [
          { 'name': term },
          { 'species': term }
        ]
      },
      { page: page }).then((results) => {
        res.render('pets-index', { pets: results.docs, pagesCount: results.pages, currentPage: page });
      });
  });
```

See what we did there? Instead of calling `Pet.find()`, we just took the query from it and had `paginate` use it!

This doesn't quite work though. The first page will look fine, but if you navigate to a different page, how do we remember what the term was? Let's pass it within `res.render` along with everything else.

> Update your `res.render` call in the `/search` route in `/routes/pets.js` to include the search term:
>
```js
res.render('pets-index', { pets: results.docs, pagesCount: results.pages, currentPage: page, term: req.query.term });
```

Why are we passing the original term and not our RegExp? Because we need the view to populate the correct URL, and it needs a string to do that!

## Update the View

Run a search on the website. Notice the url and how it captures the search term via `?term=[search-term]`? We want to make sure this gets added on to the url in addition to the page number. However, we only want to do it if a search term exists (we don't want to do this if we just navigate home, for example).

Pug let's us solve this with a simple conditional!

> Update your `ul.pagination` element in `/views/pets-index.pug` to the following. Make sure your indentation is correct!
>
```pug
ul.pagination
  if currentPage > 1
>
    li.page-item
      if term
        a.page-link(href=`?term=${term}&page=${currentPage - 1}`) Previous
      else
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${currentPage - 1}`) Previous
>
  - var i = 1;
  while i <= pagesCount
    li.page-item
      if term
        a.page-link(href=`?term=${term}&page=${i}`)= i++
      else
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${i}`)= i++
>
  if currentPage < pagesCount
    li.page-item
      if term
        a.page-link(href=`?term=${term}&page=${parseInt(currentPage) + 1}`) Next
      else
        a.page-link(href=`?page=${parseInt(currentPage) + 1}`) Next
```

# Product So Far

Try searching for something that will give lots of results (like the letter "r"). Those are some nice looking pages you got there!

Once you're all good and paginated, move on to the next chapter (but not before you do one more **Commit** for your paginated search!).

# Now Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Implemented search pagination'
git push
```

Onward!
